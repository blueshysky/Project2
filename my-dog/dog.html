        <p>
          My dog's name is Max. He is a golden retriver. He is 3 years old and is very playfull.
          He's fluffy and adorable. He would always do funny things to get us to look at him.
          Some times he would do something bad at home, but we can't get angry at him when he give such a cute look.

        <h2>His Favorite Food</h2>
        <p>
        We make home made food for Max. I didn't think that pre-made food tasted good to him.
        So we make food that Max would like to eat. At first Max didn't like some of the things we made.
        But, when we gave him beef stew, he was running in joy. So,we figured that beef stew was his most favorite food.
